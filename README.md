# Sample Superstore EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'sampleSuperstore.csv' dataset to gain insights into the business data. The EDA techniques include data summary statistics, visualization of distributions, correlation analysis, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Code

1. Download the 'sampleSuperstore.csv' dataset and place it in the same directory as the Python script.

2. Run the Python script `sample_superstore_eda.py`.

## Code Structure

- `sample_superstore_eda.py`: The main Python script containing the EDA code.
- `sampleSuperstore.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Code Overview

1. Load and Display Dataset
   - Loads the dataset and displays the first few rows.

2. Summary Statistics
   - Calculates and displays summary statistics for numerical variables.

3. Missing Values
   - Checks for missing values in the dataset.

4. Data Distribution Plots
   - Visualizes the distribution of Sales and Profit using histograms.

5. Box Plots
   - Creates box plots to visualize the spread of Profit by Category and Sales by Region.

6. Pairplot
   - Generates a pairplot to explore relationships between numerical variables.

7. Correlation Heatmap
   - Creates a heatmap to display correlations between numerical variables.

8. Count Plots
   - Generates count plots for categorical variables (Category, Region, etc.).
